# variation of `next` from `xfce4themes` - hiDPI version 
version 1.0

## Features

- Window decoration buttons for active, inactive, prelight (hover) and pressed (clicking). 
- GTK theme color pickup --- it will use the colors specified in`xfce4-appearance-settings`; not pink if you don't like. 

## Requirements

1. This theme was designed for [Xfce Desktop Environment](https://xfce.org/) on linux. Possibly other combinations can make use of it. 
2. It has been modified with a HiDPI monitor in mind and will look terrible on displays set up otherwise. 

## Installation

Put the directory into your user or system theme directory. You will be able to select this theme in the `Window manager` settings dialogue (`xfwm4-settings`).
